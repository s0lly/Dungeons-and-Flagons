Dungeons and Flagons by s0lly

Info:
Explore the dungeon and attempt your escape, while avoiding the many perils that roam the depths.
Your torch will deplete over time - make sure to collect new torches to keep the flame alive.
Your torch light will also deter ghosts, but be careful as it also serves to attract nasty skeletons.
There are a number of flagons of delicious ale dotted around the dungeons from festivities long forgotten. These will warm you up nicely and give you a boost to your speed.

Controls:
Cursor Keys move the Knight around the dungeon. These are also used in navigating menus, where the Enter key allows you to select a menu item.
Spacebar throws a torch, which kills ghosts on impact. This ability reduces the Knight's torch power.
Hold the 'M' key to see your minimap and ensure that you aren't running around in circles...
Lastly, the ESC key takes you to the pause menu, where you can save and load your game, or give up and succumb to the darkness.

Good luck!
